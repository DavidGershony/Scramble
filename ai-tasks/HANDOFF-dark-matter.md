# HANDOFF — Dark Matter migration: you are here

**Updated:** 2026-08-24 (third revision) · **Branch:** `feat/dark-matter`
(ahead of origin by two commits) · **Last commit at time of writing:** `3ed53f9`

Read this first. It tells you exactly what exists, what is next, and how to do
it. It supersedes `step6-build-start-prompt.md`, which described the state
before P0–P2 landed.

**Orientation (read once, in this order):**
1. This file.
2. `ai-tasks/scramble-marmot-phased-plan-2026-08.md` — the authoritative plan.
   §3 is the phase table; §4 the `dotnet-mls` asks; §5 the Whitenoise
   questions; §7 the binding cutover rules.
3. `CLAUDE.md` — repo invariants (I1–I5) and the Dark Matter cutover rules.

## 1. The one-paragraph situation

Scramble is replacing its Marmot engine with a standalone Dark Matter
implementation (`Scramble.Marmot.*`), built fresh against Rust `mdk` pinned at
**`wn-agent-v0.9.10`**. Planning is finished. Phases P0 (storage), P1 (epoch
state machine) and P2 (account-identity proof) are done, and P3's transport
codecs are complete — what remains of P3 needs a decoded MLS KeyPackage and so
arrives with the engine (§3b). Nothing is wired into the running app yet — the new engine is
entirely additive and nothing depends on it, so it cannot break the shipping
product. The first milestone that matters is **P6: engine v1 talking to a real
`wn-agent`**.

---

## 2. What exists now

Six new projects, all standalone (no reference to `marmot-cs`), all in
`Scramble.sln` and `Scramble.Desktop.slnf`, all running in the fast unit gate.
**495 tests in `Scramble.Marmot.Tests`, all passing.**

| Project | Phase | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| `src/Scramble.Marmot.Abstractions` | P0/P1/P3 | Ids (`GroupId`, `EpochId`, `MessageId`, `MemberId`), storage contracts and records incl. `IKeyPackageStorage`, `EpochState`, `ITransportPeeler` + `PeeledMessage` |
| `src/Scramble.Marmot.Storage.Sqlite` | P0/P3 | SQLite provider, migrations, transactions, epoch-anchored snapshots, KeyPackage bundles + private material |
| `src/Scramble.Marmot.Engine` | P1 | `EpochManager` |
| `src/Scramble.Marmot.Identity` | P2 | `AccountIdentityProof` (`0x8009`), async signer seam |
| `src/Scramble.Nostr.Crypto` | P2/P3 | BIP-340, NIP-01 event ids, NIP-44 v2, NIP-59 gift wrap, ChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope, secp256k1 |
| `src/Scramble.Marmot.Wire.Nostr` | P3 | kind-445 codec, kind-444 Welcome, kind-30443 KeyPackage, `NostrGroupPeeler` |

Also landed: two approved `dotnet-mls` changes on branch
`feat/generic-mls-additions` (AppDataUpdate proposal type; PublicMessage
produce/verify), and a `wn-agent` interop peer in `docker-compose.test.yml`.

## 3. Do this next

### 3a. The crypto review is DONE and actioned — nothing to do here

An independent review ran on 2026-08-24 and all five of its defects are fixed
(`bd5d630`, `d44f254`, `30282fa`). Do not re-commission it. What it found, so
the reasoning is not lost:

1. **kind-445 events were never verified.** The id and Nostr signature are now
   checked before any field is trusted, and the transport id is bound to the
   verified hash — it keys deduplication, so an attacker-chosen value let a
   legitimate message be dropped as a duplicate.
2. **Emoji produced the wrong event id.** Every .NET JSON encoder escapes above
   the BMP as surrogate pairs; NIP-01 requires verbatim. The serialiser is now
   hand-written. **Do not replace it with `Utf8JsonWriter`** — no encoder
   setting fixes this.
3. **Malformed input escaped as the wrong exception type**, bypassing the
   retryable/terminal classification the engine branches on. Parsing is total now.
4. **NIP-44 lacked the 2026-06-28 extended length prefix**, so large messages
   could be neither sent nor read. `nip44.vectors.json` has not been regenerated
   since the amendment, so the vector file cannot catch this — the boundary
   vectors inline in `44.md` are what pin it.
5. **Relay URLs accepted userinfo, fragments and duplicates**, contrary to the
   Marmot profile.

It also verified as sound, against external vectors: all 15 BIP-340 cases, all
35 NIP-44 conversation keys, the account-proof fixture byte for byte, the
gift-wrap trust model, and the kind-445 tag shape against upstream.

**Still open, deliberately:** no key-material zeroization anywhere (the reviewer
noted rather than escalated it; it is consistent with the previous
implementation). Worth scoping properly rather than sprinkling.

**The lesson worth keeping:** one test asserted the defect *was* the behaviour,
because the fixture it used could only ever exercise the rejection path. When
code and tests share an author, the tests are not an oracle — pin to external
vectors, and get fresh eyes on cryptography.

### 3b. P3's transport codecs are DONE — what is left of P3 needs MLS

`c72dd91` added the kind-30443 codec and `3ed53f9` the KeyPackage storage.
Both are green in the fast unit gate. What landed:

- Build (unsigned template) and verify-then-parse kind-30443 events, with the
  seven-tag cardinality rules, id-list spelling (`0x` + four lowercase hex
  digits, exact-string compared), and the `app_components`-must-carry-`0x8009`
  rule. Plus the transport candidate ranking (recency, then event id within a
  slot, then decoded KeyPackageRef across slots).
- No `encoding` tag in either direction. Inbound it is inert rather than
  rejected: kind 30443's tag set is **not closed** the way kind 445's is, so an
  unknown tag is carried past. Do not "tighten" this — rejecting unknown tags
  here invents a rule the spec does not state.
- `IKeyPackageStorage` + the SQLite table, keyed by KeyPackageRef with a second
  lookup by kind-30443 event id (what a Welcome actually names). Private
  material is persisted, and erasure is a one-way, idempotent transition; `Put`
  inserts and never replaces, so a stale record cannot resurrect erased key
  material.

**Two P3 bullets from the previous revision are NOT done, deliberately.** Both
need a decoded MLS KeyPackage, and no `Scramble.Marmot.*` project references
`dotnet-mls` yet:

- Attaching the `0x8009` proof to the LeafNode and advertising it in the leaf's
  own support list. The *transport* advertisement is done; the *leaf* one is
  KeyPackage construction.
- The two checks the codec deliberately surfaces instead of performing:
  KeyPackageRef equality against the decoded KeyPackage, and binding the event
  author to the credential identity. Both are mandatory. They are on
  `KeyPackagePublication` waiting for a caller.

These belong with KeyPackage generation, which is engine work (P6) and arrives
with the first `dotnet-mls` reference. **Do not let them fall off** — the
codec's XML docs name them, but nothing enforces them yet.

Also still open from P3's exit criterion: no `ConformanceVector` fixtures for
30443, and no `DarkMatterInterop` test that publishes a KeyPackage a live
`wn-agent` will fetch. The codec is pinned to the spec text and to
`transport-nostr-adapter/src/key_package.rs`, not to a vector.

### 3c. Then P4 — AppComponents

Scope is in plan §3. Build only the v1 set: `0x8001` profile, `0x8003`
admin-policy, `0x8004` routing, `0x8005` retention, `0x8009` proof carriage.
Media (`0x8002`/`0x8008`/`0x800b`), QUIC (`0x8006`), avatar (`0x8007`) and
lifecycle (`0x800c`) are deferred to P12 — do not build them.

P4 also owns the Current-profile group invariants: `RequiredCapabilities` must
list extension `0x0006` and proposal `0x0008`, and the required-components set
must contain `0x8003` and `0x8009`.

### 3d. Non-code items still open (not blocking)

- **Open a PR for `feat/dark-matter`.** 29 commits and growing; it is
  reviewable now and will not be after P6. This is the repo's documented
  flag-day failure mode (I4).
- **Merge `feat/generic-mls-additions`** into `dotnet-mls` `main`. It is pushed
  but unreviewed. Any NuGet tag must come after that merge, never from the
  branch.
- **Send Whitenoise the questions** in plan §5 (deployed tag, flip date,
  wire-stable tag, disband-for-interop). Q2 on legacy proofs is closed.

## 4. How to work here

**Commands.**

```powershell
# Fast unit gate — includes every Scramble.Marmot test
dotnet test Scramble.Desktop.slnf --filter "Category!=Relay&Category!=Integration" -p:DesktopOnly=true

# Just the engine tests
dotnet test tests/Scramble.Marmot.Tests

# Integration gate (needs Docker; required by CI on engine paths)
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d nostr-relay
dotnet test tests/Scramble.Diagnostics/ --filter "Category=Integration|Category=MIP-Compliance|Category=ProtocolCompliance|Category=FullE2E|Category=EpochSync|Category=DeviceSync|Category=OutboxModel|Category=Notifications|Category=RelayHarness|Category=ExporterSecret"

# The Dark Matter interop peer
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build wn-agent
docker exec wn-agent-interop wn-agent bootstrap --home /data/marmot-agent `
  --socket /run/marmot-agent/wn-agent.sock --no-quic --json

./scripts/check-drift.ps1
```

**Adding a project.** Add it to `Scramble.sln`, to `Scramble.Desktop.slnf` (or
it will not run in the unit gate), and to the path triggers in
`.github/workflows/integration.yml` (invariant I2 — engine code must not land
without the interop suite running).

**Rules that bind, and why.**
- **Standalone.** No reference to `marmot-cs` from any `Scramble.Marmot.*`
  project. Codecs are ported in. This duplicates code still in
  `Scramble.Core`; that is intended, and Core's copies go at cutover (P11).
- **No Marmot types in `Scramble.Presentation`.** Engine types stop at the
  service layer.
- **Generic Nostr crypto stays out of Marmot namespaces** — it lives in
  `Scramble.Nostr.Crypto` so a future non-Marmot provider can reuse it.
- **`lib/dotnet-mls` needs explicit permission per change.** Two items are
  approved and already done. Items (b) SelfRemove, (d) retained past-epochs and
  (f) staged-commit introspection are **not** approved — ask separately.
- **Legacy `0xf2f1` account-identity proof is out of scope** (decided
  2026-08-10). Build only Current `0x8009`. Do not re-open it.
- **Safe-export is resolved and dropped from v1** (plan §4). Do not re-open it.
- **Small commits** (I4) and **tests land with their code** (I3).

**Verify, do not assume.** Two habits earned their keep this session and are
worth keeping: mutation-check a regression test by breaking the fix and
confirming the test fails; and never trust an exit code alone — `docker compose
build` was observed exiting 0 having reached neither the daemon nor the
registry.

## 5. Traps already paid for — do not rediscover these

| Trap | What happens | The rule |
|---|---|---|
| `NBitcoin.Secp256k1.SigVerifyBIP340` | Broken on .NET Android only | Use the BouncyCastle BIP-340 implementation in `Scramble.Nostr.Crypto`. Do not "simplify" it back to the library call. |
| `encoding` tag on 445/444/30443 | Current peers reject the whole event before any MLS processing | Never emit it. kind-445 carries exactly one `h` tag and at most one `expiration`, nothing else. |
| Assuming kind 30443 has a closed tag set like 445 | Rejecting an unknown tag invents a rule the spec does not state, and breaks against a peer that adds one | 445 says "no other tag"; 30443 constrains its seven tags and is silent on others. Carry unknowns past. Duplicates of the seven are still fatal. |
| Reading only the first of a repeated tag | An attacker prepends a value another implementation ignores, so two peers disagree about one signed event | Explicitly a MUST NOT. Reject the event. |
| Uppercase hex in tags | Decodes identically but changes the event id | Lowercase everywhere on the wire. |
| Dedup on the Nostr event id | Same MLS message under a different envelope is processed twice | Dedup on `MessageId.FromMlsBytes`; transport ids are a pre-filter only. |
| `wn-agent` + private-range relay | `connector request failed`, nothing in the agent log | The agent accepts plaintext `ws://` only for a *literal* loopback host, hence `network_mode: host` and `ws://127.0.0.1:7777`. |
| `wn-agent` socket dir at `0755` | `PermissionDenied` naming no path | The socket's parent directory must be `0700`. |
| `wn-agent serve` | `unrecognized subcommand` | There is no `serve`. Running `wn-agent` bare is what serves. |
| Git Bash + `docker exec` | Paths rewritten to `C:/Program Files/Git/...` | Prefix with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`. |
| Submodule left on another branch | `Scramble.Core` fails to compile with a missing symbol | `git submodule update --init --recursive` restores the recorded commit. |
| `Utf8JsonWriter` for NIP-01 canonical form | Emoji get surrogate-escaped, so the event id differs from everyone else's | Use the hand-written serialiser in `NostrEventTemplate.Serialize`. No encoder option fixes it. |
| Pinning only to `nip44.vectors.json` | Passes while missing the 2026-06-28 amendment the file predates | Check `44.md` prose and its inline vectors too. |
| Literal U+2028/U+2029 in C# source | They are line terminators — the file will not compile | Build such strings at runtime from char codes. |
| Python `open(...,"w")` then an encode error | Truncates the file to zero bytes | Write to a temp file and move, or use the Edit tool. |

## 6. Upstream moves fast — re-check the pin

`mdk` landed ~8 commits/day through mid-2026, and the account-identity-proof
format hard-broke between two tags. Before relying on any reading of upstream:

```bash
gh api repos/marmot-protocol/mdk/tags --paginate -q '.[].name' | head
```

**Checked 2026-08-24: upstream is at `wn-agent-v0.9.14`, four tags ahead of our
`v0.9.10` pin.** Nothing was re-pinned — the 30443 work was read at v0.9.10 and
against current spec text, which agree. Someone should run the drift diff over
0.9.11–0.9.14 before P4, since the app-component work is exactly where a silent
id change would land.

If the pin needs to move, do it deliberately: bump `MDK_REF` in
`tests/wn-agent-docker/Dockerfile`, re-run the drift diff over the modules in
plan §2, and record the new pin in the plan doc. An unpinned or silently
bumped reference retargets every interop test at once.

---

## 7. The date band, for context

Wire interop with `wn-agent`: **mid-Nov 2026 / late Dec 2026 / mid-Feb 2027**
(optimistic / expected / pessimistic). Production cutover: **mid-Mar / mid-May /
mid-Sep 2027**. Assumptions and the three risks driving the width are in plan
§6. The band is wide chiefly because of upstream velocity, not because any
single piece is unknown.
